# NLP--Text_Mining01
 NLTK, or Natural Language Toolkit, is a Python library for working with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources, such as WordNet. One of the key functionalities 
 of NLTK is its support for text mining and natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Text mining involves extracting useful information and patterns from unstructured text data. NLTK provides a wide range of tools and resources to perform text mining tasks, including:

1)Tokenization: Breaking down a text into individual words or sentences is a fundamental step in text processing. NLTK provides functions for tokenizing text, allowing you to work with the basic units of the language.


2)Stopword Removal: NLTK includes a list of common stop words (e.g., "the", "is", "and") that can be removed from text to focus on more meaningful words.

3)Stemming and Lemmatization: NLTK provides tools for reducing words to their base or root form. This can be useful for grouping similar words together.

4)Part-of-Speech Tagging: NLTK can tag words in a text with their corresponding parts of speech (e.g., noun, verb, adjective).
